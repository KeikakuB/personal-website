# TODO
- Create a better home page with summaries for my blog post
    - https://middlemanapp.com/basics/blogging/
- Add an icon next to each link to show them as links and on hover change the background color of the link too.
- Try out new color schemes (white/black or black/white with pinks links might be nice)
- Fix scroll bar appearing for a split second (on my laptop) when navigating to the home page from another page.
- Fix slightly offcenter blogs (due to sidebar?)
- Make newsletter for new blog posts
- Use watchman for watching source and rebuilding site if anything changes for dev (and refreshing the browser)
- I want blurbs for my posts to display on my main page
- Figure out an rss reader again
- Have the blog be the blog and nothing else, don't link to old-style reviews and projects but keep them there
- Name the blog (brainstorm for names)
- After overhaul, post my first new blog post to hacker News
- Add a blurb to every post asking to hangout if in area and interested in tech or gaming
