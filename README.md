# TODO
- Create a better home page with summaries for my blog post
    - https://middlemanapp.com/basics/blogging/
- Add an icon next to each link to show them as links and on hover change the background color of the link too.
- Try out new color schemes (white/black or black/white with pinks links might be nice)
- Fix scroll bar appearing for a split second (on my laptop) when navigating to the home page from another page.
- Fix slightly offcenter blogs (due to sidebar?)
