In Transistor, you play the role of Red, a singer in a utopic futuristic society that has taken a turn for the worse, wielding the Transistor, a weapon that holds the soul of your recently deceased lover and might be the key to saving the world.

Transistor is a unique action adventure RPG that takes place in a beautiful and intriguing world.

## Pros

- Gameplay is an innovative mix between realtime action, turn-based tactics and strategic planning that feels great.
- Diverse number of different playstyles is allowed by the variety of abilities and how they work with each other.
- Character progression is meaningfully determined by the choices the player makes on every level up.
- Enemies grow and get stronger over time making fighting them never dull.
- Customizable difficulty rewards the player for taking on tougher challenges.
- Art will blow your socks off.

## Cons

- Constant voice in your ear might be annoying for some players (if you played Bastion and loved the Narrator then you will probably love this too though!)
