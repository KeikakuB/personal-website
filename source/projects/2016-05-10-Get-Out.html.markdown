Get Out was developed using Unreal Engine 4 for my team's final project in the DDJV program at the University of Sherbrooke (Campus Longueuil).

We were a team of six programmers including [Thomas Dobranowski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasdobra/) (AI), [Christian Nioré](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-nioré-250a8094), [Alexis Plet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexis-plet-05437a105) (Gameplay), [Charles Santourian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-santourian-745894b1) (UI), Frank Kongue Wankam (AI) and myself.

I pitched the initial idea which was based on the prototype I had built in the summer of 2015 (which I believe has been lost to time?)

I acted as the SCRUM master of the team and was responsible for keeping our team on track and working together towards the same goal.

In terms of code, I worked primarily the gameplay logic (game states, cameras, useable objects, weapon system, etc.), helping out others with networking code and participating in code review and pair programming activities.

I cooperated with [Thomas Rouby](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-rouby-67034690), a member of the other team in the program, on a common framework, used by both games, for tracking interesting gameplay events during the course of play and displaying them at the end of a session.
