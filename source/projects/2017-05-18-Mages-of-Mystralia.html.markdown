I worked at Borealys Games, an independent video game studio, from May 2016 until November 2018. I mostly worked on Mages of Mystralia but I also worked on other unannounced/cancelled projects.

We were two/three programmers working on Mages of Mystralia ([Anthony Demange](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonydemange/) as lead programmer and [Vincent Bilodeau](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentbilodeau/) as graphics programmer).

On Mages of Mystralia, I touched almost everything given the small size of the team but I focused specifically on these parts of the game:

- Gameplay
- Multiplatform development including generic port infrastructure/support and optimization for the PS4 and Xbox One ports
- UI (3D, effects, support for controller and keyboard and mouse, etc.).
- Tools (cheats, real-time debugging, editor tools, etc.).
- Build Management for PC, PS4, Xbox One, Steam, GOG, Twitch, etc.
