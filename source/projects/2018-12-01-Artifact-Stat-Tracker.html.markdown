Artifact Stat Tracker was developed in November/December 2018 using python and Google Sheets.

Data was entered into the Google Sheets document using custom built UIs, the python script would read the data within the document, manipulate it and inject it with more contextual information back into the Google Sheets document.

The Google Sheets document would then produce tables and charts with interesting data such as:

- An at a glance description of each deck used displaying the hero cards and the most important cards based on their tier.
- Win rates per card which could be used for better understanding each card's power/value.
- A running total of the real money profit made from playing the game on a weekly, monthly, yearly basis, etc.).
