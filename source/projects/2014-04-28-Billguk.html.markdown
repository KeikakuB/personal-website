Billguk the Invasion Logistics Professional was developed using Unity for Ludum Dare 29 (theme: Beneath the Surface).

> Dear Billguk,
> Today, our Guk leaders have decided to lead their fellow Guks into battle against the hated Surfacers.
> Billguk, I'm calling upon you now to perform the duty you've trained for your entire life.
> I ask you to show your fellow Guks that the Invasion Logistics Professional diploma on your bedroom wall actually means something.
> Bobbyguk Gukguk, Urgugurk War CEO
