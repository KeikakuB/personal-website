Pew Pew was developed using pico8 (which is a fantasy console with substantial constraints tied to memory, graphics, sounds, etc.) while I working at Borealys Games. I was inspired to work on this project by [Dominique Morin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominique-morin-71331621) who was truly a pleasure to work with and impressed me greatly with his portfolio of games.
