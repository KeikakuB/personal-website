blurb: 3D racing game with a custom engine.
---
Turtle Racer (AKA Grand Turtle Auto) was developed using a game engine I built (with DX10 and PhysX) based on code provided to us during the DDJV program at the University of Sherbrooke (Campus Longueuil).

The project was completed mostly by myself with the help of [Mathieu Langlois](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathieu-langlois-a019a1100) who helped close the project near the deadline.

Notably, I took an ax to the game engine and 3D rendering code we were given and built it my own way to support the project specifically. One notable system I built was a post-effect shader manager allowing us to create the opening cinematic of the game in which the turtle wakes up from a nap and dazes lazily at the sun (don't ask me how).
