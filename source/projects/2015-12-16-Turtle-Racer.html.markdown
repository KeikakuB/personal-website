Turtle Racer (AKA Grand Turtle Auto) was developed using a game engine using DX10 and PhysX based on code provided to us at the DDJV at the University of Sherbrooke (Campus Longueuil).

The project was done by a team of four programmers (Mathieu Langlois, Dominique Lacombe, Franck Kongue Wankam, and myself).

I was responsible for designing and implementing the game engine as well as implementing a post-effect shader manager allowing us to create the opening cinematic in which the turtle wakes up from a nap and dazes lazily at the sun (don't ask me how).
