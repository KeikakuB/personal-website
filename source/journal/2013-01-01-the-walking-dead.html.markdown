I've been playing video games for a long time. When I was a kid, I remember  playing Final Fantasy X on the Playstation 2. When I arrived in the flooded ruins of Zanarkand, and heard the melancholic sounds of a piano playing in the distance, I felt warm inside.

It made me feel small in a big world. It took me out of my seat and transported me thousands of miles away, to a time and place unlike my own which I could not even begin to understand.

I've read hundreds of books, I've played hundreds of games, I've watched hundreds of movies but I can count on one hand the number of times I've been sucked into a world in which I could truly forget who I am, where I am and begin to live as someone else for a short time.

The Walking Dead is an episodic Adventure Horror game developed by Telltale Games based on the comic book series by Robert Kirkman. Like most, I first came into contact with The Walking Dead not through the comic books but through the popular AMC television series by the same name.

For those who've never watched, read or played any of the works based on The Walking Dead, it follows a group of survivors of a zombie apocalypse in their quest for survival.

Its main strength is its focus on presenting the tense social interactions between the survivors. This is perhaps due to its origin as a comic book, a medium in which action-heavy storylines don't work as well as in film or tv.

In The Walking Dead video game, you become Lee Everett, a 38 year-old history professor and convicted killer. The story begins when you are being transported in a police patrol car to prison. The policeman hits a zombie on the highway and the car goes flying into a ditch.

Two days later, you wake up and find yourself surrounded by zombies (or walkers). Shortly after, you meet Clementine, an 8 year-old girl having survived on her own for the past few days.

As you and Clementine venture out into the zombie infested world, you meet others, you form a group and you go through a lot together. Suffice to say that not everyone lasts to the end.

Every time, I lost someone because of the walkers, the unfriendly but living, one of our own or even by my own hand, I felt a profound sense of loss unlike anything I've ever experienced in my life.

Throughout, The Walking Dead was emotionally draining and difficult to play. By the end, The Walking Dead metaphorically threw me off an emotional cliff and allowed me to experience the inexperiencable. I hope it does the same for you.
