During the summers of 2010 and 2011, I had a full-time job working as a meat packer at a (you guessed it!) meat packing company. For eight hours straight, me and my fellow co-workers would pack meat into boxes. It was a very dull existence but that's not to say that I didn't gain anything from the experience.

I became stronger, physically speaking. Being one of the young guys working there, I was tasked with moving a seemingly infinite number of heavy boxes from one place to another all day long. It was difficult but after a while I got used to it. Eventually, my time spent moving boxes lead me to begin doing exercise and keeping in shape at home.

I became humbled. I was one of the few workers who were students working only during the summer. The large majority of workers were men and women who worked every day of their lives in order to support their families. The work was very difficult and stressful, out of every new employee two out of three quit after their first few days. I was only there for the summer, I came to respect the people who had been working there for years not because they wanted to, but because they were forced to.

I became determined. If I needed to describe the work I had to do in one word I'd pick mind-numbing. I enjoy being challenged, mentally and physically. Picking up meat and boxes and stacking them up just wasn't doing it for me. I couldn't stand to do this kind of work for the rest of my life. Before this I had already been devoted to my education and personal growth but after experiencing first-hand what would happen if I didn't take advantage of the opportunities offered to me, I became that much more devoted to my future.

I became slightly richer. I was getting payed minimum wage, so I wasn't drowning in gold by any means but the money I made helped me become a little more independent. I've never really enjoyed spending money because I've understood that money doesn't make me happy. I buy what I need (monthly metro pass, driver permit, books for school, ...), I pay when socializing with friends (restaurant, movies, concert, ...) and sometimes I buy things for myself (Kindle, video games, ...) that's it that's all.

Last summer, I decided that I did not want to go back to the meat packing company. I decided that every week I would learn a new skill or improve myself in some way. I set clear goals for myself and by the end of the summer I had drastically improved my Windows Phone App DnD Sidekick, I had written twenty pages of a Sci-Fi novel, I had learned the basics of 3D modeling, I had learned C and more.

This summer is going to be awesome. I'll be doing an intership at CAE, the world leader in flight simulators. I'll learn something every day, I'll gain valuable work experience and I'll meet new people. I crammed all my existence and experience into a one-page resume, a cover letter and a half-hour interview. Out of all the applicants, only the best were chosen. I was chosen and therefore I must be doing right, right?
