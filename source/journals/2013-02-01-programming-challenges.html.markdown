I've played video games for most of my life and I still do. I always had a vague notion of how the games I was playing came to be. I imagined these tall and hunched-over people typing away at their computers in dark rooms with bright green text on their screens reflecting onto their glasses.

I knew little to nothing about the reality behind game development. I eventually learned about the existence of programming and its use in the making of games. I was intrigued but I had not been introduced to it in school or at home and so, sadly, it slipped past me.

In CEGEP, I met some people passionate about programming and their passion gave me the push I needed to start learning on my own. A little less than two years ago, I took matters into my own hands and taught myself to program.

I learned by following Google's Python Class. It introduced me to the basics of programming and pushed me solve relatively simple but mind-blowingly interesting problems. It was a short, sweet and formative introduction into the world of programming. I highly recommend it to anyone wishing to become fluent in a language that computers can understand.

At heart, I'm a challenge-seeker. I strive to overcome challenges in my daily life, more than most, in order to become a better person. Whether I decide to do an hour of exercise every day or eat hot peppers, I do it because I want to improve and I want to prove my worth to myself and to others.

What does this have to do with programming? Well, programming provides an environment holding an infinite number of new and exciting challenges for me to overcome. The instant I was plagued by my first bug, I knew that I had found my true calling.

I'm not alone in my love for challenges, everyone enjoys being challenged. In fact, it's coded in our genes. Every breakthrough in science, art and culture came to be because someone somewhere challenged themselves to succeed where others had failed. By pushing the envelope, these people brought progress onto the world and bettered the lives of the people around them.

Should everybody learn to program? Well, if everyone likes to be challenged and programming provides an infinite number of challenges, then the answer is obviously yes. Moreover, just like everybody should learn to read and write, I think everybody should at least dabble in the art of programming. Not so long ago, books held the key to unlocking a vast array of knowledge. Today, computers are the new gatekeepers to learning and self-improvement.

In any case, something clicked inside me. After a decade and a half of searching for something to drive me forward through life, I hit the jackpot. Not many people my age are lucky enough to stumble upon their true passion like I did. If you find yourself without a passion then I suggest that you try something new, rid yourself of your fear of failure and challenge yourself every step of the way.
