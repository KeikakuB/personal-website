........................................ peer-to-peer cheating

In a peer-to-peer architecture, the host player's client is fully responsible for simulating the shared game world inhabited by all the players. Thus, a malicious host player can modify their client through reverse engineering to give themselves an unfair advantage. For example, they could potentially make their character invincible, make their character invisible, allow their character to teleport or phase through walls, etc.

Of course, this is highly dependent on how the video game is made. The anti-cheat industry vs. video game hackers arms race is ever escalating. Some games have proven to quite the challenge to hack while others not so much. We've recently seen a new online competitive multiplayer FPS game put in place a very invasive anti-cheat solution into their game (a process that runs at start up of your computer and runs the whole time that it's on even if you don't play the game). It's all a part of the arms race!

Every game is built differently and so the specific kind of cheating that could occur in a game with a peer-to-peer architecture is vast. As is clear by the efficiency and popularity of GGPO, which is a peer-to-peer architecture, it is possible to create a peer-to-peer architecture that works and doesn't allow for cheating but it's quite hard. Fighting games are a special edge case considering that you usually only have two players playing with each other at a time, there's not much cheating that could occur given how most fighting games work and fighting games aren't popular enough to warrant the work you would need to put into making cheats for them.
