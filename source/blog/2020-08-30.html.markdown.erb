Welcome to my second "A Gamer's Guide to" article (check out my [previous one on online multiplayer video games](../../../../blog/2020-08-22.html)). Today I'll be talking about cheating in single player games on PC. If you're feeling like a rebel then by the end of this text you should be on your way to becoming a beginner single player game cheater.

Feel free to use the techniques that I describe below at your own risk, I don't advise cheating in any game that is a live service, is online in any way, has leaderboards or has micro-transactions.

You're very unlikely to succeed in your #cheatinggoals using the techniques discussed here in these cases and you might get into trouble, with the gaming police, just by trying it.

Let's get started. Today, we'll be looking at the most basic kind of cheating: using a memory scanner to scan for numbers being used in a game; allowing us to manipulate them at will.

# Basics
You may know that computers only understand two things: zero and one. Everything that a computer does at some level is zeros and ones. In my previous article, we looked at how we could transfer zeros and ones between computers to design an online multiplayer video game experience.

Today, we'll be looking at how we can manipulate zeros and ones on your own computer to cheat in a single player video game.

Zeros and ones are the fuel that make computer programs, including video games, "go". These zeros and ones have to physically exist somewhere on the computer. They are stored in one of two places, in volatile storage or in non-volatile storage.

The difference between the two is that turning off the power wipes your computer's volatile storage clean but not your non-volatile storage. A form of volatile storage that you might have heard of is RAM, or random-access memory. As for non-volatile storage, you've probably heard the terms hard disk drive (HDD) or solid state drive (SSD), if you haven't, well, now you have!

Programs of all kinds, photos, videos, any "file" really, all exist on your non-volatile storage. When you decide to play a game, a portion of it will be loaded into volatile storage because accessing data from there is much quicker than doing so from non-volatile storage.

Video games are considered to be "real-time applications" because you, as a big G Gamer, expect the video games you play to react to your actions instantly. And so, all the data that a video game requires to function like images, 3D models, gameplay numbers (health, damage, lives, positions, score, etc.) will be loaded from non-volatile storage to volatile storage either before or during gameplay.

Loading screens, which may soon disappear due to SSDs being adopted in consoles, disguise the game's loading of data from non-volatile storage into RAM. Also, open world games will dynamically load data into RAM depending on where you decide to go within the world.

So, if all the data, the zeros and ones, that make a video game, a video game exists in RAM then we could scan all of our RAM to find and manipulate variables like your character's health, the amount of money you have, the damage you do when you hit an enemy, the number of lives you have, the position of your character in the world and the list goes on and on.

All of these numbers are present in RAM and ready to be played around with. Sometimes a game developer might use obfuscation techniques to make it harder for us to find and manipulate the numbers we want to play with but this is pretty rare in purely single player video games.

If we can find the locations of these numbers in RAM, we can modify them or lock them in place. This is the most basic way of cheating in a single-player video game and is what I'll talk about next.

# Memory Scanning with Cheat Engine

> Before you do anything, one short PSA from me to you is that you should never run an executable file from a source that you do not trust. An executable file that you run can do ANYTHING it wants on your computer.

Cheat Engine is a program which allows you to analyze the memory associated to the programs that you are running on your computer, including your video games. It allows you to find the locations in RAM where game variables are which then gives you control over them.

> Be careful when installing Cheat Engine, read every page of the installer carefully, if you're not careful you'll install some ad/spyware alongside it.

Next, I'll cover the most basic use of Cheat Engine to give you a taste of what it can do but Cheat Engine includes a great beginner tutorial which I highly recommend if you want to dig a little deeper!

The simplest way of using Cheat Engine is by choosing an "easy" to manipulate variable in your game. Money/Skill points are usually a good choice because these tend to be easy to increase and decrease within the game and the actual numerical value, say 5, is usually visible to you.

- Choose your variable! Health, money, skill points, etc.
- It's easiest if you have an actual numerical value to refer to, say 50 dollars instead of a "full" health bar, but you don't *have* to know the specific value of the variable. It just makes things a little easier.
- Enter the current value of the variable, say 50, then hit the Scan button. If you don't know the current value of the variable then just hit the Scan button.
- A list of numbers should appear in the box to the left, these represent all the possibilities of locations in RAM which might represent the variable you're searching for.
- Now, you have to narrow down the list to one entry so that you can find the location in RAM that's tied to the variable you want to manipulate.
- We can continue clicking the scan button, if you set an initial value for your variable, this will reduce the number of entries because most of them are random locations in memory which may or may not change every time you hit the Scan button.
- A better way of narrowing the list down is by making playing with the variable within the game itself by making increasing it or decreasing it. For example, buying something or selling something if we're trying to find the location of the game's money variable.
    - If you can see the exact value of the number, you can type it into the text box and hit the Scan button again. This will filter out all memory locations from our previous search which aren't equal to the newly specified value for the variable.
    - Otherwise, you can click on either of the "increasing" or "decreasing" dialog boxes then hit the Scan button. This will filter out all memory locations which haven't changed in the specified way.
- By repeating this, you should eventually be able to narrow the list down to one memory location. This should be the variable you're looking for. You can confirm this by looking at the number as you change it in-game to make sure that the values you see seem reasonable
- You can now click on the memory location in the list to change it or lock it to a specific value.

There you go! You're a cheater now. Loud and proud. You can do a lot more with Cheat Engine such as automating the search for specific numbers, creating cheat "tables", and more!

# Ubisoft Strikes Again
Video game development is hard. So, game devs usually don't spend any of their valuable time on preventing players from cheating in purely single player games.

However, you might encounter a game that employs some form of obfuscation or anti-cheat solution especially if you're being naughty and trying to cheat in a game with leaderboards.

If you've ever wondered why leaderboards in most games are always filled with cheaters it's because it's pretty hard to stop people from cheating in most games.

If you're making an indie game then having leaderboards is just a recipe for disaster, don't do it. If you're making a AAA game or have a gigantic budget then think really hard about how you design your game and how you'll prevent cheaters from ruining everything.

An example of how cheaters can ruin the experience for other players is Trials Rising by our friends at Ubisoft. Trials is a time trials motorbike racing game series which I've loved for over a decade now and so when Ubisoft released the latest entry in the Trials series I was cautiously optimistic (if you're interested you can [watch or read my review of the game here](../../../../reviews/video-game/2019-03-13.html)).

They mostly did a great job. However, they really messed up one, important, thing. For months after release, players were unable to improve their times on certain tracks. This is a critical issue because a lot of the draw for players of the Trials series is the competition that occurs through the leaderboards.

In these tracks, you were pitted against the ghosts of other players on the leaderboard. Ok? Now, if you weren't able to beat a certain number of these other players then you wouldn't be able to post your improved time to the leaderboard.

Seems reasonable right?

Well, unfortunately, the top of the leaderboard for these tracks was filled with cheaters and for some reason the game would always make you race against cheaters. So, you would start the track and then watch in horror as most of the other players disappeared into thin air and instantly complete the race. It was pretty hard for legitimate players like me to beat these cheaters and thus this prevented me from improv.

Eventually they fixed this issue, and the rest of the game is really great. But, I can't stop myself from laughing at Ubisoft, they've always got something interesting cooking in their kitchen.

# Conclusion
You now have the tools to cheat in your single player games at will. I hope that this post was interesting and instructive. If you have any comments, feedback or thoughts on topics that you would like me to cover, please [let me know](mailto:me@strategineer.com)!
