You are a bounty hunter dredging through demon-infested Louisiana swamps in an alternate version of the 1930s. You need to find, then kill a demonic monster and, finally, leave the swamp as quickly as you can. Problem isâ€¦ You're not alone.

You better hope to God that you brought the right weapons and that you're not caught off guard by other bounty hunters. One mistake and not only will you be going home empty handed; you'll be returning to your friends and family in a coffin.

Hunt Showdown is the best multiplayer competitive first-person shooter I've played in a long time. If you're looking for a strategic FPS with an amazing atmosphere and a unique core gameplay loop then look no further.

To start, you hire a named bounty hunter; outfitting them as you desire. Once you've prepared yourself, it's time to hunt.

You and up to eleven other hunters in teams of two, three or going solo will start on the edges of the map. You will begin the Hunt by gathering clues in order to find the bounty's lair. There might be one or two bounties on the map. These bounties include:

- The Butcher: a constantly burning, cleaver wielding and fireball throwing mass of flesh.
- The Assassin: a swarm of cockroaches that sneaks around the floor, walls and ceilings of their lair sometimes coalescing into one whole to strike when you least expect it.
- The Spider: a giant spider that crawls all around his lair while spitting deadly poison at you and smashing into you.

If you find the lair of a bounty then you can try to take it out but beware, other bounty hunters might be on your trail; so being quiet is important. You may have to deal with other hunters, given that some or all of them are likely to be moving toward your location while you fight the bounty. If you've managed to kill the bounty without being taken out yourself then the next step is the Banishment.

Sending the bounty back to where it came from, Hell presumably, takes time. So, hunker down, watch your corners and listen. The Banishment takes a couple minutes and, during it, the location of the bounty's lair will be visible to all other hunters. They know that the bounty has already been killed; so now they'll be hunting you instead.

If you manage to survive until the end of the banishment, the bounty will yield two bounty tokens  (one for you and your partner). You'll have to pick these up and leave the area by moving to one of the three randomly positioned extraction points (horse-drawn carriages or swamp boats) on the edges of the map. Carrying a token makes you visible to every other hunter on the map. Although, the token also gives you the ability to see other hunters through buildings and vegetation for up to five seconds. This is a precious resource to be used wisely to help you escape the swamp.

If you hold your ground near an extraction point for about half a minute without other hunters contesting you, then you escape the swamp successfully and live to die another day. Your hunter collected a bounty and survived and so they gained valuable experience and loot. You can use the experience to improve your hunter's abilities and you can spend your hard earned money to equip your hunter with better weapons and tools. All in preparation for the next hunt.

And that's it.

Hunt Showdown lures you into its fantasy by immersing you in a unique and compelling environment filled with tense gunfights, stakeouts, hostage situations and deadly assaults. You start out as a hunter but  you'll become prey as you run from a threat for a better vantage point and, at the drop of a hat, you'll become bait as you draw an enemy hunter's attention away as your partner flanks them.

When playing with others, coordination and communication is key. The smart and patient hunter will have the upper hand on the careless hunter no matter the situation. Who you are and what you should be doing at any given time is fluid which is why I consider Hunt Showdown to be a "thinking man's" FPS.

If anything I've said has piqued your interest in any way, then you check out Hunt Showdown. Soon you'll be trekking through the demon-infested Louisiana swamps with the rest of us. Hunting and being hunted. Good luck partner. May you live to die another day.
