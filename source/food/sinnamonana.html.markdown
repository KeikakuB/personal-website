After watching a few travel/food shows in a row on a weekend spent working out and doing chores, I was craving a relatively healthy snack as a reward. I had just gotten a bunch of gigantic bananas at the local grocery store. I had an idea.

One sliced banana sprinkled with cinnamon and served with a side of honey for dipping, my favorite natural sweetener, and there you go. I dub thee Sinnamonana. It's simple, it's healthy and it tastes great.
