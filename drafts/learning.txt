Learning
If there's one thing I'd like to share with the world, it would have to be my love for learning. In my third year of high school, I made a new group of somewhat nerdy friends. Ever since, Learning has held an important place in my heart. 
Elements of everything I believe in can be found in learning.
Open-mindeness: You're not going far in your education, if you don't keep an open-mind.
Honesty: Be honest with yourself. What are your interests, strengths, dislikes? You'll never excel in something you dislike that's a fact.
Self-Improvement: you learn to become a better person.
Do-It-Yourself: gain skills, do what you want in life.
