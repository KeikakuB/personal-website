Darker Than Black
Darker Than Black is the best anime I've ever watched. It very different from other animes which I like very much. It doesn't follow the classic Monkey King story bullshit like every single other anime out there, like DragonBall, Naruto, One Piece. [...] 
At the outset, you don't the characters's names or what they are doing. The show pushes you into the unknown and allows you witness the world for yourself rather than spoonfeeding you. It's an amazing way of getting the viewer interested in watching your show. 
It's action packed, filled with well-thought characters.
The fact that it's not based on a manga is part of its magic. It's more free as a series to do whatever the fuck it wants.
