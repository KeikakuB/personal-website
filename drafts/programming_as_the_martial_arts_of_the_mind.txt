Programming and Writing - Part I
As a person who both programs and writes in his free time, I've noticed that programming and writing have a lot in common. They both require the same basic skills. The criteria for "good" code and "good" writing are surprisingly similar. I could go on (and I will).
In fact, programming and writing have so much in common that I wouldn't be surprised if becoming a better writer would make you a better programmer and vice-versa.
And so in this post, I'd like to go over what programming and writing have in common.
Both programming and writing… 
… require the writer to write sentences/statements in a syntactically correct way.
	Different languages have access to different words and obey different syntactical rules. No two languages share the exact same words and same rules (because then they would be the same language) therefore no two languages are written in exactly the same way.
This is the case whether we're talking about human languages or programming languages. 
Both are languages that individuals use to communicate. But, people use human languages to communicate with other people whilst people use programming languages to communicate with computers.
…require the writer to think about how their audience will interpret their writing
author: audience => reader, programmer: audience => computer
