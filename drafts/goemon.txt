I'm intrigued by Goemon and other films like it. Movies loosely based on Japanese history which take real historical events and characters and merge them both with fantastical elements such as magic and ninjas with supernatural powers.
Goemon is an epic tale telling the tale of Ishikawa Goemon, a japanese outlaw who stole valuables from the rich and gave them to the poor (like Robin Hood).
The film takes place during the end of the Sengoku Period, also known as the Warring States Period. It was a time of instability and constant military conflict. It began in the middle of the 16th century and ended at the start of the 17th century.
Goemon recounts the events leading up the Battle of Sekigahara on October 21st 1600 which led to the unification of Japan under the Tokugawa Ieyasu.
