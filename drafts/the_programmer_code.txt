[This post has high pun potential, the programmer's "code")
1) I will be nice to programmers who write "bad" code
2) I will not disrespect other programmers' favorite languages
3) I will not willingly write code that formats the user's hard drive
4) I will not write painfully obvious comments in my code (a=b; #b is assigned to a)
5) I will show respect to programmers with full beards
6) I will not use another programmer's code without their consent.
7) I will give credit where credit is due
