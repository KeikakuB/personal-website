class discussion boards => 1) guy posts retarded question that can be solved by googling it in five seconds receives twenty posts giving the answer and reiterating on the same bullshit over and over.
 2) I post a programming project that I spent 5h over the weekend because all of my friends were being lazy. Teacher sends me a message saying that's it's super fucking cool. Everyone else just ignores me.
I'm putting myself out there, trying to make some friends, share some of my work to get constructive criticism or at least some encouragment and interaction ("This looks complicated but cool, nice one Bill!", "Hey Bill, you seem to know what's up. I've been having some trouble understanding the material, could you help me out?")
But no. That's too much to ask for obviously. Five seconds of your life to say something nice to a fellow human being. Fuck you and all you stand for you piece of fucking shit.
