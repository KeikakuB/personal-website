InfiniCube - Part II - Evolution of Gameplay
I began working on InfiniCube with a simple goal: to create a fun avoid-them-all game. Even this simple premise for a game, it's incredible how much the gameplay changed during the week long development time. I was able to change the gameplay, in order to make it funner, at such a high rate because of the size of the project.
The smaller a project is, the less complex its code base is. If it's got a smaller code base then it's probably easier to make small changes to the code and create big changes in the game.
In this post, I'll take a look at each of InfiniCube's major versions, from v0.1 to v0.9, and briefly, discuss the gameplay changes that were made from version to version and what I thinking throughtout the process.
