InfiniCube - Part I - Metaphysical Analysis of Infinicube as an Interactive and Extended Allagory for Substance Abuse and Eventual Recovery
The basic premise of InfiniCube requires little explanation. It's a video game I built in Python over the course of a week in December. 
It's an oddly enjoyable "avoid-them-all" (imagine bullet hell shoot-em-up without the shooting) game in which the player takes control of a small white rectangle, called White Cube, in an attempt to avoid an "infinite" number of bigger and meaner rectangles, named the Evil Cubes.

At first glance, InfiniCube doesn't seem to offer much in terms of deeply hidden phylosophical revelations. But in reality, I built InfiniCube with the explicit goal of creating a multimedia epic art piece which offers players a deep and rewarding game of the year caliber experience, delivers a deep thorough criticism of the 17th century bourgeois lifestyle and encourages the player to join the Cold to Hot - Douchebag Elimination movement which seeks to put Canada Goose out of business by speeding up climate change in order to elimenate the people who wear Canada Goose jackets from this planet.

   
Why do I call them cubes when they're technically 2-dimensional rectangles? I do so because there is more to them than meets the eye.
